 Quite a comprehensive healthcare business application you're building with Java Spring Boot! I'll break down the key aspects, provide guidance, and offer some implementation suggestions.

**Hierarchy and Entity Relationships**

1. **Super Admin (Owner)**
        * Has many **Admins (Country)**
2. **Admin (Country)**
        * Has many **States**
        * Each State has one **State Head** (appointed by Admin)
3. **State**
        * Has many **Districts**
        * Each District has one **District Head** (appointed by State Head)
4. **District**
        * Has many **Talukas**
        * Each Taluka has one **Taluka Head** (appointed by District Head)
5. **Taluka**
        * Has many **City/Villages**
        * Each City/Village has many **Data Collectors (Surveyors)** (appointed by Taluka Head)
6. **Data Collector (Surveyor)**
        * Collects data, which is reviewed and approved by the hierarchy (Taluka Head → District Head → State Head)

**Implementation Suggestions**

### 1. Database Design

Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool like Spring Boot's default **Hibernate** or **JPA (Java Persistence API)**. Design your database tables with the following entities and relationships:

| Entity | Columns | Relationships |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **User** | id, email, password, role (SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN, STATE_HEAD, DISTRICT_HEAD, TALUKA_HEAD, DATA_COLLECTOR) |  |
| **Admin** | id, user_id (FK), country | One-To-One with User |
| **State** | id, admin_id (FK), name | Many-To-One with Admin |
| **StateHead** | id, state_id (FK), user_id (FK) | Many-To-One with State and User |
| **District** | id, state_id (FK), name | Many-To-One with State |
| **DistrictHead** | id, district_id (FK), user_id (FK) | Many-To-One with District and User |
| **Taluka** | id, district_id (FK), name | Many-To-One with District |
| **TalukaHead** | id, taluka_id (FK), user_id (FK) | Many-To-One with Taluka and User |
| **CityVillage** | id, taluka_id (FK), name | Many-To-One with Taluka |
| **DataCollector** | id, city_village_id (FK), user_id (FK) | Many-To-One with CityVillage and User |
| **CollectedData** | id, data_collector_id (FK), ... (other data columns) | Many-To-One with DataCollector |
| **ApprovalHistory** | id, collected_data_id (FK), approver_id (FK), status (APPROVED, REJECTED, EDITED) | Many-To-One with CollectedData and User |

### 2. Handling District Head Departure

* **Soft Delete**: Implement a soft delete mechanism for the departing District Head's user account. This will maintain the integrity of the existing relationships.
* **Reassign Talukas**: Provide an interface for the State Head to reassign the Talukas (and their Heads) to another District Head.

### 3. Admin Registration and Password Setup

* **Email-based Password Setup**:
        1. When a higher authority registers a new user, generate a **token** (e.g., UUID) and store it with the new user's email.
        2. Send an email to the new user with a link containing the token (e.g., `https://your-app.com/setup-password?token=<UUID>`).
        3. When the new user clicks the link, verify the token and prompt them to set their password.
        4. Hash and store the new password with the user's account.

**Example Code Snippets (Java Spring Boot)**

### User Entity
```java
@Entity
public class User {

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  private Long id;

  private String email;
  private String password;
  private Role role;

  // Getters and Setters
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  private Long id;

  private String email;
  private String password;
  private Role role;

  // Getters and Setters
  private Long id;

  private String email;
  private String password;
  private Role role;

  // Getters and Setters
  private String email;
  private String password;
  private Role role;

  // Getters and Setters
  private String password;
  private Role role;

  // Getters and Setters
  private Role role;

  // Getters and Setters

  // Getters and Setters
  // Getters and Setters
}
```

### Admin Registration with Password Setup

### Admin Registration with Password Setup
### Admin Registration with Password Setup
```java
```java
@Service
@Service
public class UserService {

  @Autowired
  @Autowired
  private UserRepository userRepo;

  @Autowired
  private EmailService emailService;

  public void registerAdmin(AdminDTO adminDTO) {
    User user = new User(adminDTO.getEmail(), Role.ADMIN);
    user.setToken(UUID.randomUUID().toString()); // Generate token
    userRepo.save(user);

    // Send email with password setup link
    emailService.sendPasswordSetupEmail(user.getEmail(), user.getToken());
  }
}
```

### Password Setup Controller
```java
@RestController
public class PasswordSetupController {

  @Autowired
  private UserService userService;
